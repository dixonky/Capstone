## Vulnerability Outline
**To exploit the vulnerabilities outlined below, utilize the secret-keeper-not-secure branch**

### Brute-Force Attack
**brutePass.sh**
* BrutePass takes advantage of the PUT login to test username and password combos
* Usernames are provided by the script user
* Passwords are taken from passwords.txt which has the 10000 top passwords

**Directions to use brutePass.sh:**
1. Place brutePass.sh and passwords.txt in the same directory
2. Open a connection to osu servers (do not use flip3, or the same server as the site is hosted if not flip3)
3. Open the directory with brutePass.sh
4. You may need to give yourself permission to run the script: chmod 777 brutePass.sh

**To use the script:** ./brutePass.sh -g username URL

**Examples:**
* ./brutePass.sh -g Kyle flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061
* ./brutePass.sh -g Katie flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061
* ./brutePass.sh -g Admin flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061


### SQL Injection Attack

### HTML Injection Attack
**To inject a script:**
1. Sign into any existing user account
2. Add a new record, using the following as the value for one field in the form: "&amp;gt;<script>alert("Warning: This site is vulnerable to an attack")</script>
3. Note the popup alert warning of possible attack

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack
